                    HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies involved. 
                    It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to create content 
                    for the web. And, luckily for us, it's surprisingly easy to learn. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
                    "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to 
                    identify different types of content and the purposes they each serve to the webpage.

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website 
                    should actually appear on the frontend of the page.HTML provides the raw tools needed to structure content on a website. 
                    CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the way it was intended to be seen. 
                    These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're reformatted. 
                    If HTML is the drywall, CSS is the paint. That's why Css plays an important role in web development.

                    JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it 
                    behave in different ways in response to a user's actions. Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation 
                    boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information. In short, JavaScript is a programming 
                    language that lets web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page 
                    is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.
